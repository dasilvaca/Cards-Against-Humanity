# Cards-Against-Humanity

## For developers

### Requirements

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Django 3.2.8 or higher
- Virtualenv 20.8.1 or higher

Principles:

- Try always to use a virtual environment set everytime you writte or collaborate in this repository. So, if you don't have virtualenv installed, please install it with the following command:

```bash
python3 -m pip install virtualenv
```

In order to create a virtual environment, you must run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv CAH
```

This will create a folder called CAH, which contains the virtual environment. To activate it, you must run the following command:

```bash
source CAH/bin/activate
```

To deactivate it, you must run the following command:

```bash
deactivate
```
